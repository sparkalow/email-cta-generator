HTML Email CTA Button Generator
===============================
This client side React app generates HTML markup suitable for use in emails with good compatibility accross a range of destop and mobile clients.

Email is deceptively difficult. This has been thoroughly tested, however your mileage may vary. It's recommended that you test using a service like [Litmus](http://litmus.com), [Email on Acid](https://www.emailonacid.com/) and/or your own devices.

Although the markup generated is for use in various email clients, the app is designed to be used in modern browsers.
